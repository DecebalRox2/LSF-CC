# LSF-CC
Program that takes in a set of data points from an Excel file and calculates the least squares fit of the data and the correlation coefficient, among other values.

Input your data points into a spreadsheet similar to the one in the repo, run the code, choose whether you want to weight the data points (to get a weighted least squares fit if uncertainties are not the same) and get a bunch of useful values from your data.
